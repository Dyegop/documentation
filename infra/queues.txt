------ QUEUES AND MESSAGES ------

Queues and messages are used to exchange data between systems. Specifically, they are often used to share events between systems.
Messages are data (often in json format) which are put on the queue by the producers and read from the queue by subscribers.
The message can be a data object fully contained by itself or, it can be a reference to an external event.

A queue is just a service which can store these messages for a period of time. That way, the producers and subscribers can work at
their own pace, and if one goes down that will not affect the others. Compare this to HTTP / webhooks, where the producer is unable
to deliver a message if the subscriber is offline.
