Basic concepts:
	-A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs, similar to JSON objects. 
	-MongoDB stores documents in collections which are analogous to tables in relational databases.
	-A view (MongoDB v3.4+) is a read-only queryable object whose contents are defined by an aggregation pipeline on other collections or views.

Aggregation Pipeline:
	-An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents.
	-Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.
	-The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
	-An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.

QUERIES:
	-Find documents with array_lenght > n -> {$expr:{$gt:[{$size:"$array"}, n]}}
	-Find multiples elements -> {key : {"$in" : [value1, value2, ...]}}
		Example: 
			{"_id" : {"$in" : [ObjectId("6439cb494a8d4f8b9eec91ba"), ObjectId("6414d46b8f9a0d2f006dd114")]}}
			
	-Find documents with array values matching conditions -> {"array_name": {$elemMatch: {"value1": "foo", "value2": "bar", ...}}}
		Example:
			{"appraisal.checks": {$elemMatch: {"name": "DuplicateAttractions", "passed": false}}}
	-Find documents where field exists: {field: {$exists: <boolean>}}
